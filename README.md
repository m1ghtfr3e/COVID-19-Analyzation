All working programs can be found in the master branch.

&
https://pomber.github.io/covid19/timeseries.json



### How it works:
1) Download 'Covid19DataAnalyze_v1.1.py' and 'covid_json_crawler.py' and make sure that they are in the
   same directory together. 
2) Open a terminal and type 'python Covid19DataAnalyze_v1.1.py'
   The program is running now and is ready to use.
