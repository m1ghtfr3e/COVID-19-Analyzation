# COVID-19-Analyzation
Data Processing and Visualization of Covid19 data sets
As program is not too efficient right now, nothing was merged to the master until now.
Working programs can be found in the "Working-patches" branch.
Feel free to contribute.

Datasets are from https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset
