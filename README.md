# COVID-19-Analyzation

Data Processing and Visualization of Covid19 data sets
All working programs can be found in the master branch.
If you want to look through the process, just check the other branches.

Feel free to contribute.

Datasets are from:
https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset
&
https://pomber.github.io/covid19/timeseries.json


The main program which is in the master branch now, uses the 'timeseries.json' data from the second link
above. Download it and make sure it is in the same directory as the program so it can run.

I am running this program in Spyder3. If you have Anaconda you can use it too or run it in jupyter.
Make sure that Python3 and the pandas module is installed.

Also on Linux the program (Version 1.1) works in your terminal, so you don't need to run it within a specific program.
If you run the Web Crawler it will download the needed file (timeseries.json) for you.
