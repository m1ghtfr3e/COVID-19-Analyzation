# COVID-19-Analyzation
Data Processing and Visualization of Covid19 data sets
As program is not too efficient right now, nothing was merged to the master until now.
Working programs can be found in the "Working-patches" branch.
Feel free to contribute.

Datasets are from https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset  &
                  https://pomber.github.io/covid19/timeseries.json


The main program which is in the master branch now, uses the 'timeseries.json' data from the second link
above. Download it and make sure it is in the same directory as the program so it can run.
